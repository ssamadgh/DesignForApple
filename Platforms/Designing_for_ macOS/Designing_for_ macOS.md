# Designing for macOS

<p align="center"><img src=Photos/platform-macOS-intro_2x.png width=90%/>

Great Mac experiences **integrate the platform and device capabilities that people value most**. To help your design feel at home in macOS, prioritize the following ways to incorporate these features and capabilities.

- Leverage large displays to present more content in fewer nested levels and with less need for modality, while maintaining a comfortable information density that doesnâ€™t make people strain to view the content they want.

- Let people resize, hide, show, and move your windows to fit their work style and device configuration, and support full-screen mode to help people focus in a distraction-free context.

- Use the menu bar to give people easy access to all the commands they need to do things in your app.

- Help people take advantage of high-precision input modes to perform pixel-perfect selections and edits.

- Support keyboard shortcuts to help people accelerate actions and support keyboard-only work styles.

- Enable personalization, letting people customize toolbars, configure windows to display the views they use most, and choose the colors and fonts they want to see in the interface.
