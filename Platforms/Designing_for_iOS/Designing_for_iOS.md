# Designing for iOS

Great iPhone experiences **integrate the platform and device capabilities that people value most**. To help your design feel at home in iOS, prioritize the following ways to incorporate these features and capabilities.


- Help people **focus on primary tasks** and content by **limiting the number of onscreen controls** while making **secondary details and actions discoverable with minimal interaction**.

- **Adapt seamlessly to appearance changes** — like device orientation, Dark Mode, and Dynamic Type — **letting people choose the configurations that work best for them**.

- **Enable interactions that support the way people usually hold their device**. For example, it tends to be easier and more comfortable for people to reach a control when it’s located in the middle or bottom area of the display, so it’s especially important let people swipe to navigate back or initiate actions in a list row.

- **With people’s permission, integrate information available through platform capabilities in ways that enhance the experience without asking people to enter data**. For example, you might accept payments, provide security through biometric authentication, or offer features that use the device’s location.
