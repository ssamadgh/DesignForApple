Create an app or game that feels at home on every platform you support.

## Overview

To design for each platform we should know how people look at and interact with that.

| Platform	| Overview     		|
|------------	|------------|
| iOS 			|People depend on their iPhone to help them stay connected, play games, view media, accomplish tasks, and track personal data in any location and while on the go.							|
|iPadOS		|People value the power, mobility, and flexibility of iPad as they enjoy media, play games, perform detailed productivity tasks, and bring their creations to life.|
|macOS			|People rely on the power, spaciousness, and flexibility of a Mac as they perform in-depth productivity tasks, view media or content, and play games, often using several apps at once.|
|tvOS			|People enjoy the vibrant content, immersive experiences, and streamlined interactions that tvOS delivers in media and games, as well as in fitness, education, and home utility apps.|
|watchOS		|When people glance at their Apple Watch, they know they can access essential information and perform simple, timely tasks whether they’re stationary or in motion.|

## Display

Display is one of the most important contexts which user should cross to access to app's content. So, we should have a deep undrestanding about display of each platform.


| Platform	| Display     		|
|------------	|------------|
| iOS|	iPhone has a **medium-sized**, **high-resolution** display. |
| iPadOS |	iPad has a **large**, **high-resolution** display. |
| macOS	|	A Mac typically has a **large**, **high-resolution** display, and people can extend their workspace by connecting **additional displays**, including their iPad.|
| tvOS	|	A TV typically has a **very large**, **high-resolution** display.|
| watchOS	|	The **small** Apple Watch display **fits on the wrist** while delivering an easy-to-read, **high-resolution** experience.|


## Ergonomics

Ergonomics is about how people use their devices.

| Platform	| Ergonomics     	|
|------------	|------------|
| iOS|	People **generally hold their iPhone in one or both hands** as they interact with it, **switching between landscape and portrait** orientations as needed. While people are interacting with the device, their viewing distance tends to be **no more than a foot or two**.|
| iPadOS |	People **often hold their iPad while using it**, but they might also **set it on a surface** or **place it on a stand**. Positioning the device in different ways **can change the viewing distance**, although people are **typically within about 3 feet of the device** as they interact with it.
| macOS	|People **generally use a Mac while they’re stationary**, often placing the device **on a desk or table**. In the typical use case, the **viewing distance can range from about 1 to 3 feet.**|
| tvOS	|	Although people **generally remain many feet away from their stationary TV — often 8 feet or more** — they sometimes **continue to interact with content as they move around the room.**|
| watchOS|	Because **people wear Apple Watch**, they’re **usually no more than a foot away from the display** as they **raise their wrist to view it and use their opposite hand to interact with the device.** In addition, the **Always On display lets people view information on the watch face when they drop their wrist.**|	
> **Note**: A foot is about 30.5 cm


## Inputs

Input is about how a platform receives user info to make better experience of using device.



| Platform	|    Inputs 		|
|------------	|------------|
| iOS|**[Multi-Touch gestures](), [onscreen keyboards](), and [voice]() control** let people perform actions and **accomplish meaningful tasks while they’re on the go**. In addition, people **often want apps to use their [location]() and input from the device’s [accelerometer and gyroscope]()**, and they may also want to **participate in [spatial interactions]()**.	|
| iPadOS |	People can interact with iPad using [Multi-Touch gestures]() and [onscreen keyboards](), an attached [keyboard]() or [pointing device](), [Apple Pencil](), or [voice](), and **they often combine multiple input modes**.|
| macOS	|	 People expect to enter data and control the interface using any combination of input modes, such as physical [keyboards](), [pointing devices](), [game controllers](), and [voice]().	|
| tvOS	|	People can use a [remote](), a [game controller](), their [voice](), and apps running on their other devices to interact with Apple TV.|
| watchOS|	Using standard [Multi-Touch gestures]() like tap, swipe, and drag lets people control their experience even while they’re in motion. Turning the [Digital Crown]() imparts additional precision and feedback to scrolling interfaces, pressing the [Action button]() initiates an essential action without looking at the screen, and using [Siri Shortcuts]() can help people perform their routine tasks quickly and easily. People also appreciate taking advantage of data that device features — like GPS, sensors for blood oxygen and heart function, altimeter, accelerometer, and gyroscope — can provide.	|	

## App interactions

It matters how people interact with a platform, how many time they spend on and how they use it.

| Platform	|  App interactions   		|
|------------	|------------|
| iOS|Sometimes, people spend just **a minute or two checking on event or social media updates, tracking data, or sending messages.** At other times, people can spend **an hour or more browsing the web, playing games, or enjoying media.** People **typically have multiple apps open at the same time**, and they **appreciate switching frequently among them**.	|
| iPadOS |	Sometimes, people **perform a few quick actions on their iPad**. At other times, they spend hours **immersed in games, media, content creation, or productivity** tasks. People **frequently have multiple apps open** at the same time, and they a**ppreciate viewing more than one app onscreen** at once and **taking advantage of inter-app capabilities like drag and drop**.|
| macOS	|	 Interactions can last anywhere **from a few minutes** of performing some quick tasks **to several hours** of deep concentration. People **frequently have multiple apps open** at the same time, and they **expect smooth transitions between active and inactive states as they switch from one app to another**.	|
| tvOS	|	People can get **deeply immersed in a single experience** — often **lasting hours** — but they also appreciate using a picture-in-picture view to simultaneously follow an alternative app or video.	|
| watchOS|	People often **glance at the Always On display many times** throughout the day, performing **focused app interactions** that can **last for less than a minute** each. People **frequently use a watchOS app’s related experiences** — like complications, notifications, and Siri interactions — **more than they use the app itself**.	|	


## System features
There are some system features that help people interact with the system and their apps in familiar, consistent ways.
