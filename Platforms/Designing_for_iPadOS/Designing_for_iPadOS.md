# Designing for iPadOS


<p align="center"><img src=Photos/platform-iPadOS-intro_2x.png width=90%/>

Great iPad experiences **integrate the platform and device capabilities that people value most**. To help your experience feel at home in iPadOS, prioritize the following ways to incorporate these features and capabilities.

- **Take advantage of the large display** to elevate the content people care about, **minimizing modal interfaces and full-screen transitions**, and **positioning onscreen controls where they’re easy to reach, but not in the way**.

- Use viewing distance and input mode to help you **determine the size and density of the onscreen content you display**.

- Let people use Multi-Touch gestures, a physical keyboard or trackpad, or Apple Pencil, and **consider enabling unique interactions that combine multiple input modes**.

- **Adapt seamlessly to appearance changes** — like device orientation, multitasking modes, Dark Mode, and Dynamic Type — **and transition effortlessly to running in macOS**, **letting people choose the configurations that work best for them**.
