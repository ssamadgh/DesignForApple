# Designing for watchOS

<p align="center"><img src=Photos/platform-watchOS-intro_2x.png width=90%/>

Great Apple Watch experiences **integrate the platform and device capabilities that people value most**. To help your experience feel at home in watchOS, prioritize the following ways to incorporate these features and capabilities.

- Enable quick, glanceable interactions that deliver critical information succinctly and help people perform targeted actions with a simple gesture or two.

- Personalize the experience by proactively anticipating people’s needs and using on-device data to provide actionable content that’s relevant in the moment or very soon.

- Use [complications]() to provide relevant, potentially dynamic data and graphics right on the watch face where people can view them on every wrist raise and tap them to dive straight into your app.

- Use [notifications]() to deliver timely, high-value information and enable important actions people can take without opening your app.

- Support Siri to help people access shortcuts on the Siri watch face.

- Design your app to function independently, complementing your notifications and complications by providing additional details and functionality.
