<p align="center"><img src=Photos/platform-tvOS-intro_2x.png width=90%/>

Great tvOS experiences **integrate the platform and device capabilities that people value most**. To help your experience feel at home in tvOS, prioritize the following ways to incorporate these features and capabilities.

- Enable powerful, delightful interactions through the fluid, familiar gestures people make with the Siri Remote.

- Embrace the tvOS focus system, letting it gently highlight and expand onscreen items as people move among them, helping them know what to do and where they are at all times.

- Deliver beautiful, edge-to-edge artwork, subtle and fluid animations, and engaging audio, wrapping people in a rich, cinematic experience thatâ€™s clear, legible, and captivating from across the room.

- Enhance multiuser support by making sign-in easy and infrequent, enabling shared sign-in, and automatically switching profiles when people change the current user.
